  <h3>Tracking the Trump administration's purge of CDL training provider accreditations (2026)</h3>
  <div class="project-description">
    <p>
    After introducing new restrictions on the classes of immigrants eligible for commercial driver's licenses (CDL) last fall, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced in December that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) had also begun removing thousands of CDL training providers from the federal accreditation registry. Duffy accused providers targeted in the purge of falsifying training data and failing to meet required curriculum requirements and instructor qualifications, among other breaches of accreditation requirements. <a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">Many in the trucking industry welcomed the shake-up</a> as a long-overdue response to loose licensure practices in the industry, but it remains unclear whether the FMCSA formally investigated all of the now-decertified providers. In Wisconsin, city governments and the state Department of Corrections were stripped of accreditation without notice from the FMCSA. How many of the CDL training providers purged in the past year were engaged in fraudulent licensing practices?

      Officers fired by Washington law enforcement agencies disproportionately
      find work with tribal police departments (2024)
    </h3>

    <div class="project-description">
      <p>
        Washington's Public Safety Civil Service Commission, responsible for certifying sworn law enforcement officers in the state, tracks each officer's career from the date of their certification to the date of their retirement from law enforcement or decertification. <br>
        Roughly 8% of Washington's law enforcement agencies are tied to tribal governments. They are overrepresented among agencies that have hired law enforcement officers who have been fired by one or more previous law enforcement employers, at least in part because tribal law enforcement agencies often offer lower salaries than their non-tribal counterparts.
